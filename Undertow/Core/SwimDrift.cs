    /// the mechanism this file's own backlog entry originally prescribed — is WORSE. Read it:
    /// it ignores the magnitude of `m_pushForce` completely and drives velocity to a flat 20 m/s
    /// along its direction (halved to 10 while swimming). It exists to shove a body out of a
    /// creature it is clipping through. Routing a 0.3 m/s current through it would launch a
    /// swimmer at five times swim speed. Verified by decompile 2026-08-28, after the plan said
    /// otherwise.
    ///
    /// So the current is added to `m_currentVel` directly — but SCALED BY THE SWIM ACCELERATION,
    /// which is the part that is easy to get wrong by a factor of twenty.

    /// by the reciprocal of the lerp factor:
    ///     v* = target + d / m_swimAcceleration

    /// TIMES the current. Multiplying by the acceleration first cancels it exactly, leaving
