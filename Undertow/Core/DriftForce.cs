    /// THE MODEL IS ENTRAINMENT, NOT DRAG, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE FILE.
    ///
    /// The obvious model is drag toward the water: force proportional to (water - hull), so a
    /// boat asymptotically takes up the speed of the water it sits in. It is wrong here, and
    /// wrong in a way that only shows up under sail. Vanilla ALREADY models hull-water
    /// resistance — `m_damping`, `m_dampingForward`, `m_dampingSideway` in the method this
    /// feeds — computed against the hull's absolute velocity, i.e. assuming the water is still.
    /// Adding a second drag term against the hull's full velocity double-counts it. A karve
    /// making 6 m/s through water moving at 0.3 would receive
    /// `0.6 * (0.3 - 6) = -3.4 m/s^2` — the sea as a brake on every boat under way, which is
    /// both unphysical and would read to a player as the mod breaking sailing.
    ///
    /// So the current is applied as a PUSH along the water's own direction, saturating as the
    /// hull takes up the water's speed. It carries a boat and never fights the sail.
    ///
    /// WHY SATURATION RATHER THAN A CALIBRATED PUSH — measured on a live server 2026-08-28, and
    /// this killed two earlier models in one reading. The first attempt matched a push against
    /// vanilla's quadratic damping so the two would balance at the water's speed. That requires
    /// knowing the hull's damping coefficient, and `m_dampingForward` is a SERIALIZED UNITY
    /// FIELD — every boat prefab overrides it. The class default read off the decompile (0.01)
    /// applies to no actual boat: a VikingShip measured ~0.0053 effective, and settled at 1.38x
    /// the water's speed instead of 1.0. A raft, a karve and a longship would each land on a
    /// different multiple, so NO single constant can be right.
    ///
    /// Fading the push out as the hull approaches the water's speed sets the equilibrium
    /// directly, by construction, without knowing anything about how the hull damps. Every boat
    /// type converges on the same answer, and the number `wake here` prints is the speed a
    /// sailor will actually drift, on any hull.
    ///
    /// The hull's velocity is a parameter again — but only its component ALONG the current, and
    /// only through a term clamped to [0,1]. That clamp is the anti-braking guarantee that the
    /// earlier signature enforced by omission: the result can never oppose the current, so a
    /// boat under sail is never slowed, it merely stops being helped.
