# Undertow

> *The sea remembers where it is going.*

A Valheim mod by **Raven Iron**. Valheim's ocean already has weather — waves that answer the
wind, storms that raise them, a hull that takes damage in a seaway. What it doesn't have is
**water**. Nothing moves. A karve left at half sail on a fixed heading arrives exactly where
geometry says it will, every time, in every part of the map.

Undertow gives the sea its own motion. Currents run across the ocean in a shape you can learn:
a slow basin drift, a stream that follows the coast, fast water between close islands, and dead
water behind a headland. They carry what floats on them.

**No map, no HUD, no icons.** The sea shows its own motion the way water does — foam lying
along the flow, moving with it, glassy where it goes dead — and nothing reads it out for you.

## What it does

### 🌊 The sea has a shape
A current field spread across the whole ocean, built from a stream function — so the flow is
**divergence-free**, the way real water is. Gyres, races and slack water all fall out of the
same mechanism rather than being placed by hand.

- **The drift** — slow, basin-scale, the thing you plan a long voyage around.
- **Coastal set** — a stream that follows the shore, with a slight push toward it. This is why
  you don't doze at the tiller with the coast downwind.
- **Races** — water accelerates between close landmasses. A narrow gap is fast water, in one
  direction, and a 300m strait counts as much as a gap between rocks.
- **Slack and eddies** — where opposing arms meet, the water goes dead. Things collect there.

It is **the same on every machine** without a byte of network traffic: the field is a pure
function of the world seed, the position, the world clock and the season. Two players a thousand
metres apart compute the same water and never have to agree about it.

### 🌒 Tides
A slow flood and ebb on a configurable cycle. It swings how hard the open ocean runs and
**reverses the coastal stream**, so the passage you know is a different passage six hours later.
Departure time becomes a decision.

### ⛈ Storm surge *(with Ragnarok's Wrath)*
Where a Devastating Storm stands, the water rises — **there and nowhere else**. A sheltered
passage stops being sheltered while the storm sits over it. Entirely optional: without
Ragnarok's Wrath the bridge logs its absence once and the sea runs regardless.

### ⛵ Boats are carried, never braked
The current adds to a hull rather than fighting it, so sailing is never slowed — you are simply
somewhere else than you expected. A boat left drifting settles at **the water's own speed**, and
that is true of a raft, a karve and a longship alike. A hull resists sideways drift about twice
as hard as forward drift, which falls out of Valheim's own physics rather than being imposed.

**Boats with nobody aboard are not touched, by default.** Vanilla already damps an unmanned hull
almost to a stop, and a moored longship wandering off while you are away is not a feature.

### 🪵 Flotsam
Currents converge, so things gather. Driftwood, cargo and what the drowned no longer need
collect in slack water — giving you a second reason to know where the sea goes quiet. While a
storm is overhead, what washes up is wreckage instead.

Uses **only vanilla items**, never a new prefab. Capped, reclaimed on a timer, and spawned only
near a real player — an empty ocean stays empty.

### 🏊 Swimmers
The current carries a swimming body too, gently. It is **hard-capped below swim speed**: you can
always out-swim the water and reach shore. That is a safety property rather than a balance dial,
and it is enforced across every setting the config permits.

### 🌫 The sea shows its set *(0.7.0)*
Faint foam streaks lie along the current on the water itself, move at the water's own speed and
ride the swell — thick in a race, sparse at a trickle, **absent in slack water, which stays
glassy**. From a drifting hull they hold station alongside; under sail they stream past at the
crab angle, and that angle is the set. Nothing states it: no arrow, no number, no screen element.
The streaks are symmetric end to end, so a glance gives you the line of the flow and only
watching gives you the sense — which is how a sailor reads a tide.

Client-side and cosmetic. It changes nothing about how a boat or swimmer moves, is never
networked or saved, and a dedicated server ignores it. Night, fog, distance and a big sea dim it
on their own. `EnableDriftLines` turns it off; section `7 - Drift lines` tunes count, radius,
opacity and a per-frame cost budget the mod enforces on itself.

---

## Install

Drop `Undertow.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/` on the **server and every client**. Boat physics runs
on whichever machine owns the hull — a player's — so a server-only install pushes nothing.

Config appears at `BepInEx/config/com.raveniron.undertow.cfg`. Every system has its own switch;
every rate, cap and threshold is tunable.

**Keep the config identical on the server and every client.** The field is recomputed
independently on each machine, so a client with different settings sails a different ocean.
The one exception is section `7 - Drift lines`, which is per machine by nature: foam is drawn by
the client that looks at it, so two players on one deck see the same set, density and speed from
the same field, but not the same individual streaks.

## The `wake` console

| Command | Answers |
|---|---|
| `wake status` | what this machine is, and what is running on it |
| `wake here` | the current under your keel — speed, bearing, depth, tide |
| `wake field <x> <z>` | the current anywhere, loaded or not |
| `wake drift` | whether the current is actually reaching boats |
| `wake floats` | which item prefabs carry `Floating` (the flotsam palette) |
| `wake lines` | whether the current is showing on the water, and what it costs (`wake lines reset` rebuilds it) |

Turn on `VerboseLogging` and the log carries a boot-time transect of your seed's ocean, plus a
running readout of drift while you sail.

## Plays well with

- **Ragnarok's Wrath** (Raven Iron) — detected automatically. Storms raise the sea where they
  stand and the season shifts the drift. Optional; absence is logged once and changes nothing else.
- **Seasonality / Seasons** — never touched. Undertow selects no environment, reads no season
  directly, and modifies no material.
- **Boat stat mods** should compose: they change the hull, Undertow changes the water.

## What it deliberately is not

No map, no compass, no wind gauge, no HUD of any kind — the drift lines are the sea, not an
instrument: nothing is drawn on the screen and nothing reads the current out. No new prefabs, assets or bundles. No
second wave system and no weather — vanilla and Seasonality own that ground. No boat rebalancing
and no new ship types. Undertow changes the sea and nothing else.
